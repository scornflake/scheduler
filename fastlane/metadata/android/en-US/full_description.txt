Smart & easy scheduling of teams and/or people within an organisation. Born from having to sort out the schedules for a music team in a church setting. There *has* to be a better (faster!) way! And there is.

It takes the pain out of working out the plan. It'll handle all of the layout for you (including unavailability, preferred roles etc). It aims to do ~95% of your "grunt" scheduling work.
