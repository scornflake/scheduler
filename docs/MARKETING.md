- I want to free you to build relationships with your team, instead of working on schedules
- Let worship leaders lead
- I want leaders to have confidence that they are meeting peoples expectations (yep, I've got you on bass more than drums)
- I want to free you to listen to more music/make more music/practice more/sing more, instead of working on schedules
- I want to help team members remember they are on, so we can all be reminded to practice and become better
- I want to take the pain away from scheduling and make it the easiest part of the role



USP
- Spend more time in relationship with your team
- Leaders take charge of their teams, schedule sets
- Remove the "pain points"
    - Have the system work out the schedule, remind people that they need to provide unavailability dates, and provide a way for members to preview the schedule before it gets finalized.
    - Have "the system" remind people they are on & what music is set
    - Click track to drummer
    - Automate member swaps and notifications
    - Integrate with MultiTracks for practice
    - Export to google sheets if you want a simple self hosted schedule.
    - Manage a shared Music calendar, *per person*, so they know when they are on.
    - Manage a shared global music calendar with all people on all days (maybe?)




Unsure
------
- *Export to google sheets if you want a simple self hosted schedule* (might remove / might restrict / read only). It's useful now, but if the web interface and app is there, really?
