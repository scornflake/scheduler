The Rethink (v2)
================

There's no chance in v1 to 'iterate to try other outcomes'
Depth first (by single role & date) fails because it doesn't take into account other roles the person might choose. So if it's possible to place someone in "vocal", it does so, ignoring other roles.
Breadth first is better, but it is hard to implement a weighted-role system... and it means you have to have *every role* on the same layout priority to have any chance at all.

How might weighted roles work?
------------------------------
#### Objects
- Roles
    - [done] Priority
    - [done] Has "pick" rules (used to pick the next person to fulfill this role), examples: "Usage Weighted Sequential", "Definitely on this Date"
    - [done] Priority could still be used to group roles together, or force a role to be laid out first (e.g: leaders)
- Person
    - has roles, role rules & placement rules.
    - Roles are just a list. Possibilities.
    - default rule might be "in sequence (round robbin)"
        - which is just a weighted with even weighting?
    - Alternative might be "Weighted: Sax 80%, Sound 20%"
    - Another "Weighted: Leader 90%, Guitar: 10%"
- Placement
    - date
    - original role
    - actual role
    - rules used
- Pick Rules
    - Group of PickRule
- Pick Rule
    - execute(state):Person
    - usage weighted sequential
    - not on this date
    - not on this date range
- Role Rules
    - Group of RoleRule
    - execute(state):Role
- Role Rule
    - weighting
    - execute(state):Role
    - on this date I want role X

#### Algorithm
- Iterate all dates, in order
- Initialize pick rules
- [done] Sort people by the max role layout priority they are in. This puts leaders, sound and computer guys first in the list (meaning they are chosen first)
- [done] Choose the next role to look at (using existing role priority groups as a way to perform grouped layouts)
- [done] Find people suitable for this role (subset)
- [done] Choose the next person using the pick rule for that role
  - This assumes we've created a pick rule for e.g:'worship leader'
- [done] It would then *re-pick the role* in which to place the person.
  - [done] This is done with the role rules of the person.
  - Execute each active rule in priority order.
    - A rule returns a set of possible roles, in order. If no roles, can't place.
    - Input to the rule is the last ordered set of roles.
    - A rule can halt execution by returning no roles
- If the role differs, recurse (to place the person), then return and restart the process of placing someone in the role for the current date.
- If no role is returned, we cannot place the person. For now, we HAVE to go back, choose the NEXT person, and try again for this date. If no people can be found, only then do we move on.
- If a role is returned
  - trigger placement rules
  - record the placement reasoning (date, roles, all rules triggered)

Pick Rules
----------
Validation would be needed (can't have two Def on date rules for diff people on same date)
- Definitely on Date X (a high priority rule that overrides other pick rules)
- e.g: Usage Weighted Sequential
    - Thinking about layout of leaders. If a leader can't make it, they can be skipped. BUT we really want to use them next possible chance.
    - So the REAL "sequence" is usage based.
    - Each person in the list starts with a counter of 0.
    - As they are placed, the counter is incremented for them.
    - The people "order" is sort by count (asc), then by original index order.


This gives us access to the people that have been on the least.
But in an order where it's fair to all leaders (round robbin).

Role Rules
----------
- They have to have priority (so you know which to execute first)
- They might have enabled, disabled or a active date range (so you can pin people to teams)
- "Weighted: Sax 80%, Sound 20%"
- With X up to Y times (Never with X is just 'with X up to 0 times')
- Always with person Z in role Y (a way of pinning someone to a leader)
- Always with person Z (a way of pinning someone to someone else)

Placement Rules
---------------
Used when a person is placed into a position
- When placing in role Y, add roles Q,P

Example
-------
- Lay down all leaders
- This will leave some keys, vocal and guitar positions also filled
- Lay down Neil (sound, sax, with 80% sax weighting):
  - 1) lay down sax first (ranked the highest) - score is now { sax: 100%, sound: 0%)
  - 2) sound next, because sax >= weighting - score is now { sax: 50%, sound: 50%)
  - 3) sax next, because sax < weighting - score is now { sax: 66%, sound: 33%)
  - 4) sax next, because sax < weighting - score is now { sax: 75%, sound: 25%)
  - 5) sax next, because sax < weighting - score is now { sax: 80%, sound: 20%)
  - 6) sound next, because sax >= weighting - score is now { sax: 66%, sound: 33%)

Previously, we laid out a role fully. This didn't work because it stopped other roles from being fired (cos the person already had an exclusion zone).

This might work better because we are intentionally laying out a persons roles in full.



What happens if things are full and you can't?
----------------------------------------------
The above is really simple when the roster is empty.




Obstacles / TODO:
=================
- People placed first win, automatically (because the roster is less full, they are likely to get the spots).
  - this may be naturally what we want. We could in fact sort by 'leader, sound, computer ... rest' as a good alternative to role layout priority. *It's not about the role, it's about the person?*. Inherent favortism.
  - The person ordering could be modified by the interface, and run in that order. It'd let you play a bit (and show favortism to people).
- The existing 'layout priority' doesn't lend itself to anything other than "layout the leaders first". Anything split by layout priority means it's gets *total* preference.
- Roles might need a 'required' flag on them. In the case where we are trying to do weighted layout, but the role is required, we might choose it instead of whatever is 'correct' at the time.
- Have I an answer for "cherilyn would *like to have* X,Y,Z as vocalists"
- With the rule "With X up to Y times"
    - how do you evaluate it? You can't really until you have run the whole thing.
    - Do you then re-run it with additional exclusions for that person?
    - How do you make this part work?

Wondering about:
================
1. Placing leaders first. I think this works well. Placing their dependent roles is sensible.



Everything is rules?
====================

- Availability is a rule "place me once every 2 weeks"
- Unavailability is a rule "don't place me here"
- Don't pair me with X
- DOn't pair me with X more than Y times

Can the entire placement algorithm be expressed as rules?
It'd make extending it MUCH easier.




Rule Execution / Iterators
==========================

So. Have iterators. And they suck.

The original idea was that i'd be lazily returning state. Now, with RuleFacts, I can't think of a good reason to continue doing it (and it doesn't read well in code either)

Rather: Shouldn't the rules ALWAYS return the same state, given the same RuleFacts?
So the usage of people over time, state currently baked into the rules themselves... shouldn't this be moved into RuleFacts?

Then:
1. Rules execute, and use current facts to return a result.
2. Facts are modified
3. When rules next execute - because facts are different, we get a different result.


Rather than having 'Rules' objects, just have one Rules(Engine)
This contains all rules. We gather rules to execute based on criteria (e.g: all for this role, or this person, or this day) and execute those. We get a result.

The caller no longer needs to know the rule that triggered, because it'll be updating FACT state not rule state.

Hmm. Does this mean the schedule itself becomes part of the facts? Probably.
Basically the rules need to be able to ask:

- How many times has this person been scheduled on for this role?
- What is the original ordering of people, for this role?
- Is this person in role X?

This worked well!




TODO v3
=======
- Exclusions should be turned into rules (and can then be part of 'next suitable person')
