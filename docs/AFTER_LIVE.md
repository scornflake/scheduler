These are intended to be issues that dont affect me being able to get it out there, to be used, to be experimented with.  Sure, they might SUCK from a UI perspective, but they don't *prevent* functions from working.

- Full View
    - If on iPad, doesn't look right
        - Fix date column, left side
        - Make roles scroll (but not date)
        - Word wrapping in columns is breaking the CSS grid drawing and also screwing up the header heights (see guitars)
        - Provide more width for info
        - Search bar on iOS is broken (the title shows through it)

- As an admin:
    - Tap person in the 'phone' view to show a popup of when they are on?
        - Or a menu of 'edit person'
        - Or... their person details directly? so unavail can be modified?

- Export
    - To my calendar
    - To a organization calendar
